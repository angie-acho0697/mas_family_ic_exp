# üèõÔ∏è Family Inheritance Experiment: A Multi-Agent Drama

**What happens when four cousins inherit an art gallery and must make unanimous decisions about its future?**

This experiment simulates the complex dynamics of family inheritance through an advanced multi-agent system. Using CrewAI and Google Gemini, it models how four distinct personalities navigate high-stakes decisions, form alliances, manage conflicts, and evolve relationships over time.

## üé≠ The Story

Four cousins inherit their great-aunt's art gallery with **equal ownership** but a **unanimous decision requirement** for major changes. Over 6 months, they face escalating challenges: viral fame, family interference, legal threats, and valuable discoveries. Each cousin has distinct goals, strengths, and weaknesses that create natural tension and coalition dynamics.

**The question**: Can they work together to transform the gallery into a profitable venture, or will family dynamics tear them apart?

## Relationship Dynamics System

### Trust Levels
- **Initialization**: Personality-based variation from 0.3 to 0.7 (base: 0.5 ¬± 0.1)
- **Calculation Formula**: `trust_level = base_trust + personality_factor`
- **Personality Factor**: `(hash(cousin_id + target_cousin) / 255.0 - 0.5) * 0.2`
- **Updates**: Based on LLM analysis of specific interactions between cousin pairs
- **Change Amount**: `base_change * confidence` where `base_change = 0.15`

### Conflicts
- **Detection**: LLM-powered analysis of conversation content
- **Severity Levels**: Low (0.2), Medium (0.5), High (0.8)
- **Confidence Threshold**: > 0.5 for inclusion
- **Impact**: Reduces trust levels between involved cousins
- **Fallback**: Keyword-based detection if LLM analysis fails

### Alliances
- **Detection**: LLM-powered analysis of collaboration patterns
- **Strength Levels**: Weak (0.3), Medium (0.6), Strong (0.9)
- **Confidence Threshold**: > 0.5 for inclusion
- **Impact**: Increases trust levels and creates social connections
- **Fallback**: Keyword-based detection if LLM analysis fails

### Social Connection Strength
- **Initialization**: 0.5 for new connections
- **Calculation Formula**: 
  ```
  strength = (trust_level √ó 0.6) + (alliance_bonus √ó 0.25) - (conflict_penalty √ó 0.15) + (context_bonus √ó 0.1) + personality_factor
  ```
- **Personality Factor**: `¬±0.05` variation based on cousin pair hash
- **Strengthening**: +0.1 per interaction (capped at 1.0)
- **Bounds**: [0.0, 1.0]

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Types**: Leadership, Collaboration, Competition, Compromise, Assertiveness, Cooperation, Passive, Analytical
- **Detection**: LLM-powered analysis of conversation context
- **Confidence Threshold**: > 0.5 for inclusion
- **Impact Assessment**: Positive, Negative, or Neutral
- **Fallback**: Keyword-based detection if LLM analysis fails

## Resource Framework

### Individual Resources (per cousin)
- **Time**: 40 hours/week (160 total hours weekly)
- **Money**: Personal budget that grows based on individual success
- **Social Connections**: Dynamic strength-based connections with other cousins
- **Reputation Points**: Tension between group brand building vs. individual credit claiming

### Shared Resources
