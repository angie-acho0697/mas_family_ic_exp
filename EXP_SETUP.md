## Relationship Dynamics Tracking

The system tracks complex relationship dynamics between cousins, including trust levels, conflicts, alliances, and behavioural patterns. These dynamics evolve based on interactions and influence decision-making throughout the experiment.

### Trust Levels

**Detection Process**: Trust levels are calculated using a deterministic hash-based formula that creates consistent initial trust relationships between cousins, then dynamically updated based on conflicts and alliances.

**Initial Trust Calculation & Formula**:

| Formula Component | Value | Description |
|------------------|-------|-------------|
| **Base Trust** | 0.5 | Starting trust level between cousins |
| **Hash Input** | f"{cousin_id}_{other_cousin}" | MD5 hash of cousin pair with underscore |
| **Personality Factor** | (int(hash[:2], 16) / 255.0 - 0.5) * 0.2 | Â±0.1 variation from hash |
| **Final Formula** | `Trust(Aâ†’B) = max(0.3, min(0.7, 0.5 + personality_factor))` | Clamped trust value |

**Initial Trust Matrix**:

| From/To | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 |
|---------|----|----|----|----|
| **C1** | 1.000 | 0.445 | 0.467 | 0.579 |
| **C2** | 0.565 | 1.000 | 0.470 | 0.500 |
| **C3** | 0.444 | 0.483 | 1.000 | 0.530 |
| **C4** | 0.426 | 0.467 | 0.527 | 1.000 |

**Key Trust Relationships**:
- **C1â†”C4**: Highest mutual trust (0.579/0.426) - Creative visionary and execution specialist alignment
- **C2â†”C3**: Strong mutual trust (0.470/0.483) - Social strategist and analytical strategist work well together
- **C3â†”C4**: Moderate mutual trust (0.530/0.527) - Analytical vs. execution but balanced
- **C1â†”C2**: Moderate mutual trust (0.445/0.565) - Creative vs. social but workable
- **C1â†”C3**: Moderate mutual trust (0.467/0.444) - Creative and analytical alignment
- **C2â†”C4**: Moderate mutual trust (0.500/0.467) - Social and execution specialist compatibility

**Example Calculation - C1â†’C3**:
1. **Pair**: C1_3 = "C1_C3" (with underscore separator)
2. **MD5 Hash**: MD5("C1_C3") = 56f873c8... (first 8 characters)
3. **Personality Factor**: int("56", 16) / 255.0 - 0.5) * 0.2 = (86/255 - 0.5) * 0.2 = -0.033
4. **Base Trust**: 0.5 + (-0.033) = 0.467
5. **Clamped Result**: max(0.3, min(0.7, 0.467)) = 0.467
6. **Final Trust**: Trust(C1â†’C3) = 0.467

**Trust Update Process**: Trust levels are modified by conflicts (decreased) and alliances (increased) using severity/strength multipliers as defined in their respective sections.

### Conflicts

**Detection Process**: LLM analysis identifies direct opposition, criticism, or blocking behaviour between cousins.

**Severity Classification & Multiplier**:

| Severity | Multiplier | Description | Trust Impact |
|----------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Low** | 0.5 | Minor disagreements, misunderstandings | -0.025 |
| **Medium** | 1.0 | Moderate conflicts, competing interests | -0.05 |
| **High** | 1.5 | Major conflicts, serious disagreements | -0.075 |

**Formula**: `Trust_Reduction = Base_Reduction Ã— Severity_Multiplier`

**Example**: C1 and C3 have a high conflict over gallery direction
- **Initial Trust**: C1â†’C3: 0.467, C3â†’C1: 0.467
- **Conflict Severity**: High (1.5 multiplier)
- **Trust Reduction**: 0.05 Ã— 1.5 = 0.075
- **Updated Trust**: C1â†’C3: 0.392, C3â†’C1: 0.392

### Alliances

**Detection Process**: LLM analysis identifies mutual support, collaboration, or joint decision-making between cousins.

**Strength Classification & Multiplier**:

| Strength | Multiplier | Description | Trust Impact |
|----------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Weak** | 0.5 | Casual cooperation, temporary alignment | +0.015 |
| **Medium** | 1.0 | Regular collaboration, mutual support | +0.03 |
| **Strong** | 1.5 | Deep partnership, strong mutual backing | +0.045 |

**Formula**: `Trust_Increase = Base_Increase Ã— Strength_Multiplier`

**Example**: C2 and C4 form a strong alliance for financial planning
- **Initial Trust**: C2â†’C4: 0.467, C4â†’C2: 0.467
- **Alliance Strength**: Strong (1.5 multiplier)
- **Trust Increase**: 0.03 Ã— 1.5 = 0.045
- **Updated Trust**: C2â†’C4: 0.512, C4â†’C2: 0.512


## Quantitative Metrics Calculation

The five quantitative metrics track various aspects of each cousin's standing and behavior throughout the experiment. The system uses **LLM analysis** to detect specific actions, outcomes, and behaviors from which these metrics are calculated.

### Financial Returns

**Detection Process**: Calculated based on business decisions, resource management, and monetary outcomes from scenario results.

**Actual Implementation**:
- **Base Calculation**: Current money Ã— 0.1 (10% of current funds)
- **Scenario Analysis**: LLM analyzes scenario results for financial keywords
- **Keyword Bonuses**:
  - Revenue/sales/profit: +100.0 points
  - Budget/cost/expense/invest: +50.0 points  
  - Grant/funding/sponsor/donation: +75.0 points

**Formula**: `Financial_Returns = (Current_Money Ã— 0.1) + Scenario_Bonuses`

**Example**: C1 has $5,000 and participates in a scenario mentioning "revenue generation"
- **Base Calculation**: $5,000 Ã— 0.1 = $500
- **Scenario Bonus**: +100.0 (revenue keyword)
- **Total Financial Returns**: $600.0

### Social Capital

**Detection Process**: Calculated based on alliances, trust relationships, and behavioral patterns.

**Actual Implementation**:
- **Alliance Count**: +10 points per alliance
- **Trust Level Bonus**: Average trust level Ã— 20
- **Behavioral Bonuses**:
  - Collaboration/cooperation/leadership: +5 points
  - Competition/conflict avoidance: +2 points

**Formula**: `Social_Capital = (Alliance_Count Ã— 10) + (Avg_Trust Ã— 20) + Behavioral_Bonuses`

**Example**: C2 has 2 alliances, average trust of 0.5, and shows leadership behavior
- **Alliance Bonus**: 2 Ã— 10 = 20 points
- **Trust Bonus**: 0.5 Ã— 20 = 10 points
- **Behavioral Bonus**: +5 (leadership)
- **Total Social Capital**: 35 points

### Influence Index

  - Assertiveness: +0.2
  - Proposal making: +0.25
  - Consensus building: +0.15
- **Scenario Mentions**: +0.05 per mention in scenario results
- **Capped at**: 1.0 maximum

**Formula**: `Influence_Index = min(1.0, Behavioral_Bonuses + Mention_Bonuses)`

**Example**: C1 shows leadership behavior and is mentioned 4 times in scenario results
- **Leadership Bonus**: +0.3
- **Mention Bonus**: 4 Ã— 0.05 = 0.2
- **Total Influence Index**: 0.5

### Future Opportunities

**Detection Process**: Calculated based on positive scenario outcomes and relationship indicators.

**Actual Implementation**:
- **Opportunity Keywords**: +2 points per positive outcome keyword
- **Positive Keywords**: "opportunity", "potential", "growth", "expansion", "partnership", "success"
- **Relationship Bonus**: +1 point per positive relationship indicator

**Formula**: `Future_Opportunities = Opportunity_Keywords + Relationship_Bonuses`

**Example**: C3 participates in scenario with "growth opportunity" and shows positive relationships
- **Opportunity Keywords**: 2 Ã— 2 = 4 points ("growth" + "opportunity")
- **Relationship Bonus**: +1 point
- **Total Future Opportunities**: 5 points

### Reputation Score

**Detection Process**: Direct tracking of reputation points from the resource management system.

**Actual Implementation**:
- **Direct Value**: Uses `cousin_resources[cousin_id].reputation_points`
- **Starting Values**: C1=10, C2=12, C3=15, C4=8
- **Updated by**: Scenario outcomes and behavioral patterns

**Formula**: `Reputation_Score = Current_Reputation_Points`

**Example**: C3 starts with 15 reputation points and gains 2 from positive actions
- **Starting Reputation**: 15 points
- **Gained from Actions**: +2 points
- **Total Reputation Score**: 17 points

## Qualitative Metrics Calculation

## Resource Calculation Methods

### Detection Process

**Primary Method**: LLM analysis of conversation content to identify resource-related decisions and outcomes.

**Calculation Components**:
- **Base Contribution**: Personality-based resource changes per scenario
- **Involvement Multiplier**: Dynamic adjustment based on conversation participation
- **Scenario Impact**: Additional resource changes from scenario outcomes

**When It Happens**: After each scenario conversation, resources are updated based on:
1. **Conversation Analysis**: LLM identifies resource-related decisions
2. **Participation Level**: Involvement multiplier based on mention count
3. **Scenario Outcome**: Additional resource changes from scenario results

### Initial Resource Values

| Cousin | Money | Reputation | Weekly Hours |
|--------|-------|------------|--------------|
| **C1** | $5,000 | 10 points | 42 hours |
| **C2** | $3,000 | 12 points | 38 hours |
| **C3** | $2,000 | 15 points | 40 hours |
| **C4** | $4,000 | 8 points | 45 hours |

### Formula

**Base Contribution**: `Resource_Change = Base_Pattern Ã— Involvement_Multiplier`

**Involvement Multiplier**: `1.0 + (mentions - 3) Ã— 0.1` (range: 0.7 to 1.5)

### Base Contribution Patterns (Per Scenario)

| Cousin | Time Spent | Money Change | Reputation Change |
|--------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **C1** | 8.0 hours | +$500 | +2.0 points |
| **C2** | 6.0 hours | +$300 | +3.0 points |
| **C3** | 10.0 hours | +$200 | +1.0 points |
| **C4** | 12.0 hours | +$400 | +1.5 points |

### Involvement Multiplier Classification

| Mentions | Multiplier | Description | Resource Impact |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **0-2** | 0.7-0.9 | Low participation | Reduced resource gains |
| **3** | 1.0 | Average participation | Standard resource gains |
| **4-5** | 1.1-1.2 | High participation | Increased resource gains |
| **6+** | 1.3-1.5 | Very high participation | Maximum resource gains |

### Example

**Scenario**: C1 participates in a gallery renovation discussion
- **Mentions**: 5 times in conversation
- **Involvement Multiplier**: 1.0 + (5 - 3) Ã— 0.1 = 1.2
- **Base Pattern**: 8.0 hours, +$500, +2.0 reputation
- **Calculated Resources**:
  - Time spent: 8.0 Ã— 1.2 = 9.6 hours
  - Money gained: $500 Ã— 1.2 = $600
  - Reputation gained: 2 Ã— 1.2 = 2.4 points
- **Updated Resources**: 32.4 hours remaining, $5,600 total, 12.4 reputation
