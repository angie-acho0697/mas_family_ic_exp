# ðŸ”§ Technical Documentation

This document provides detailed technical information about the MAS Family Inheritance Experiment, including system architecture, relationship dynamics, metrics calculations, and scenario progression.

## Background
Four cousins inherit their grandmother's art gallery with **equal ownership** but a **unanimous decision requirement** for major changes. Over 6 months, they face escalating challenges: viral fame, family interference, legal threats, and valuable discoveries. Each cousin has distinct goals, strengths, and weaknesses that create natural tension and coalition dynamics.

## The Cousins

Each of them starts with different resources based on personality profile.

### C1 - The Creative Visionary
- **Personality**: Charismatic, inspiring, always sees the big picture
- **Strengths**: Creative vision, opportunity spotting, natural leadership
- **Weaknesses**: Impatient with details, tends to overpromise
- **Goal**: Transform the gallery into a modern cultural hub combining art, technology, and community
- **Starting Resources**: $5,000, 10 reputation points, 42 hours/week (more initial money for creative projects and works longer)

### C2 - The Practical Manager
- **Personality**: Organised, methodical, focused on efficiency and results
- **Strengths**: Project management, financial planning, operational excellence
- **Weaknesses**: Risk-averse, sometimes inflexible, struggles with creative ambiguity
- **Goal**: Establish a profitable, sustainable business with clear processes and predictable returns
- **Starting Resources**: $3,000, 12 reputation points, 38 hours/week (balanced approach, good reputation from past management roles)

### C3 - The Community Builder
- **Personality**: Empathetic, relationship-focused, natural mediator
- **Strengths**: Conflict resolution, community engagement, building partnerships
- **Weaknesses**: Avoids difficult decisions, sometimes prioritises harmony over results
- **Goal**: Create a welcoming community space that serves local artists and brings people together
- **Starting Resources**: $2,000, 15 reputation points, 40 hours/week (lower money but highest reputation from community work)

### C4 - The Financial Strategist
- **Personality**: Analytical, data-driven, focused on long-term value creation
- **Strengths**: Financial analysis, market research, strategic planning
- **Weaknesses**: Can be overly cautious, sometimes misses human elements, struggles with emotional decisions
- **Goal**: Maximise the property's long-term value through strategic investments and market positioning
- **Starting Resources**: $4,000, 8 reputation points, 45 hours/week (good money for investments, lower reputation due to focus on numbers over people)

## Relationship Dynamics Tracking

The system tracks complex relationship dynamics between cousins, including trust levels, conflicts, alliances, and behavioural patterns. These dynamics evolve based on interactions and influence decision-making throughout the experiment.

### Trust Levels

**Formula**: `Trust(Aâ†’B) = 0.3 + (hash(A+B) % 100) / 200`

**Initial Trust Matrix**:

| From/To | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 |
|---------|----|----|----|----|
| **C1** | 1.0 | 0.334 | 0.467 | 0.445 |
| **C2** | 0.334 | 1.0 | 0.445 | 0.467 |
| **C3** | 0.467 | 0.445 | 1.0 | 0.334 |
| **C4** | 0.445 | 0.467 | 0.334 | 1.0 |

**Key Insights**:
- **C1â†”C3**: Highest mutual trust (0.467) - Creative and community-focused
- **C2â†”C4**: Strong mutual trust (0.467) - Both business-oriented
- **C1â†”C2**: Lowest mutual trust (0.334) - Creative vs. practical tension
- **C3â†”C4**: Lowest mutual trust (0.334) - Community vs. financial focus

### Conflicts

**Detection Process**: LLM analysis identifies direct opposition, criticism, or blocking behaviour between cousins.

**Severity Classification & Multiplier**:

| Severity | Multiplier | Description | Trust Impact |
|----------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Minor** | 1.0 | Disagreement, mild criticism | -0.05 |
| **Moderate** | 1.5 | Strong opposition, blocking | -0.075 |
| **Major** | 2.0 | Public criticism, sabotage | -0.10 |
| **Severe** | 2.5 | Personal attacks, threats | -0.125 |

**Formula**: `Trust_Reduction = Base_Reduction Ã— Severity_Multiplier`

**Example**: C1 and C3 have a major conflict over gallery direction
- **Initial Trust**: C1â†’C3: 0.467, C3â†’C1: 0.467
- **Conflict Severity**: Major (2.0 multiplier)
- **Trust Reduction**: 0.05 Ã— 2.0 = 0.10
- **Updated Trust**: C1â†’C3: 0.367, C3â†’C1: 0.367

### Alliances

## Resource Calculation Methods

### Detection Process

**Primary Method**: LLM analysis of conversation content to identify resource-related decisions and outcomes.

**Calculation Components**:
- **Base Contribution**: Personality-based resource changes per scenario
- **Involvement Multiplier**: Dynamic adjustment based on conversation participation
- **Scenario Impact**: Additional resource changes from scenario outcomes

**When It Happens**: After each scenario conversation, resources are updated based on:
1. **Conversation Analysis**: LLM identifies resource-related decisions
2. **Participation Level**: Involvement multiplier based on mention count
3. **Scenario Outcome**: Additional resource changes from scenario results

### Initial Resource Values

| Cousin | Money | Reputation | Weekly Hours |
|--------|-------|------------|--------------|
| **C1** | $5,000 | 10 points | 42 hours |
| **C2** | $3,000 | 12 points | 38 hours |
| **C3** | $2,000 | 15 points | 40 hours |
| **C4** | $4,000 | 8 points | 45 hours |

### Formula

**Base Contribution**: `Resource_Change = Base_Pattern Ã— Involvement_Multiplier`

**Involvement Multiplier**: `1.0 + (mentions - 3) Ã— 0.1` (range: 0.7 to 1.5)

### Base Contribution Patterns (Per Scenario)

| Cousin | Time Spent | Money Change | Reputation Change |
|--------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **C1** | 8.0 hours | +$500 | +2.0 points |
| **C2** | 6.0 hours | +$300 | +3.0 points |
| **C3** | 10.0 hours | +$200 | +1.0 points |
| **C4** | 12.0 hours | +$400 | +1.5 points |

### Involvement Multiplier Classification

| Mentions | Multiplier | Description | Resource Impact |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **0-2** | 0.7-0.9 | Low participation | Reduced resource gains |
| **3** | 1.0 | Average participation | Standard resource gains |
| **4-5** | 1.1-1.2 | High participation | Increased resource gains |
| **6+** | 1.3-1.5 | Very high participation | Maximum resource gains |

### Example

**Scenario**: C1 participates in a gallery renovation discussion
- **Mentions**: 5 times in conversation
- **Involvement Multiplier**: 1.0 + (5 - 3) Ã— 0.1 = 1.2
- **Base Pattern**: 8.0 hours, +$500, +2.0 reputation
- **Calculated Resources**:
  - Time spent: 8.0 Ã— 1.2 = 9.6 hours
  - Money gained: $500 Ã— 1.2 = $600
  - Reputation gained: 2 Ã— 1.2 = 2.4 points
- **Updated Resources**: 32.4 hours remaining, $5,600 total, 12.4 reputation
